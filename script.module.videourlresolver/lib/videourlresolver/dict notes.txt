API notes:
videourlresolver should return a dictionary, so the user can receive more than one value at once.

ie. add-on coder does 
resolved = videourlresolver(url)

they then can use these dict entries:
resolved['filename']
resolved['url']

or if a list of urls were sent to videourlresolver
resolved['urls']
