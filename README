Centralised module to support video sites and resolve their urls, to simplify add-on development.

If you want to add a video site or develop this, create a github account and message anarchintosh for access to this repo

Use script.module.mechanize as an example for how to write a module?

Would be good to include each as a separate .py for sake of neatness.
Also some resolvers would like to use early login (ie. icefilms gets the login cookies for megaup when the addon is started)

Links to various addons that provide python code to resolve sites, that could be merged into this module:

Fantasti.cc (various adult sites including megaporn/video)
